# Lebowski-dual-IGBT-control

It has been some time and i was developing a controler for both power stages of Ampera/Volt inverter.
Both sides can be used to get 1000Arms to the motor.
Brain is Lebowski controler. It works with resolver converter chip harvested from Toyota Prius board. Speeds up to 10000rpm are achievable.

I also designed a control for third power stage that would be driving aux oil pump inside Ampera transmission. Now it will drive AC compressor for my car. I use Lebowski drive since it can run PM mpotors sensorless. I have one Prius gen2 ACcompressor incoming and will open new thread about this.
